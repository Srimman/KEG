This is the project based on surveillance which uses
1. OpenCV (computer vision for recognition of women running)
2. Tensorflow (we are using VGG16 model to train with pose estimator for detecting the running pose of women)
3. Dronekit-python (python library to communicate with drone)
4. MavSDK (softeware development kit for controlling drone)
5. Raspberry Pi (companian computer for the image processing to work)
6. Pixhawk (flight controller for drone with PX4 stack)
7. Web Socket (used to send packets i.e location from server to client using internet)
